# R&D in Data Science and Forecasting

Welcome to my R&D repository, a comprehensive collection of my code, experiments, and projects undertaken during my data science learning journey. The initial focus has been on time series forecasting, exploring models like ETS, ARIMA, and Auto ARIMA. As this journey progresses, I plan to delve into more diverse and meticulous projects across different areas of data science.

## Introduction

This repository serves as both a personal learning diary and a showcase of my exploration into various data science methodologies. The goal is to build a robust portfolio of projects ranging from foundational statistical models to cutting-edge machine learning algorithms.

## Current Projects

### Time Series Forecasting

- **ETS Model Experiments:** An exploration of Exponential Smoothing State Space models, understanding their application in forecasting.
- **ARIMA and Auto ARIMA Experiments:** A series of projects focused on the implementation and tuning of ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models for better prediction accuracy.

## Upcoming Projects

The roadmap for future projects includes but is not limited to:

- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Deep Learning Applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
- Big Data Analytics with Spark and Hadoop
- Reinforcement Learning Experiments

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the projects, clone this repository and set up the environment with the necessary dependencies.
